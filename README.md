# Rock Paper Scissors Game
# Overview
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where the user can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly selects a move from the same choices. The game updates scores dynamically and follows these rules:
* Rock beats Scissors <br>

* Scissors beats Paper  <br>

* Paper beats Rock  <br>

* Draws do not increment the score  
# Features
* User-friendly interface with neon-style icons. <br>

* Random choice generation for the computer.<br>

* Score tracking for both the user and the computer.<br>

* Dynamic result display (win, lose, or draw).
  
# Technologies Used

* HTML - Structure of the game. <br>

* CSS - Styling and layout. <br>

* JavaScript - Game logic and interaction.

# How to Play

* Open the game in a web browser. <br>

* Click on one of the three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.<br>

* The computer will randomly select its choice.<br>

* The result will be displayed (Win, Lose, or Draw) along with updated scores.<br>

* Play again and have fun!
